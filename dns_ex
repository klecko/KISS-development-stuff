#USAGE
#First you write the domain you want to redirect, and after it you write the 
#IP address you want to redirect it to. The program will see if one of the following
#domains is contained in the asked domain. You can also use * as a domain if you want
#to redirect every other page to a single IP address. There can only be one of those rules.
#Other option is to place * as the IP. That means the domain won't be redirected.
